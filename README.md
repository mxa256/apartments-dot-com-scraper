# Apartments dot com Web Scraper
<br/>
This is a python webscraper that uses Beautiful Soup to extract addresses, links, and prices for apartments in the San Francisco area. You can choose your city and price range on apartments dot com, and use your own URL for this code. I then use Selenium web driver to enter apartment information into a Google form, which autopopulates an excel sheet so all of my apartment data is nicely organized.
